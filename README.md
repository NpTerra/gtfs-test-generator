# Usage

1. 💾 Clone the repo
2. 🛠️ Run the program once with the **'Launcher with Maven compile'** configuration.
    - *This will pull needed dependencies and create the "generated" and "tests" directories with an example already inside.*
3. ✍️ Write your own tests following the format of **example.yaml** inside the "tests" directory.
    - *(Just don't forget to add the trips for each line at the end of a model.)*
5. 😎 Run the program again with either **'Launcher with Maven compile'** or the normal **'Launcher'** configuration.
6. 💯 __*Profit*__
