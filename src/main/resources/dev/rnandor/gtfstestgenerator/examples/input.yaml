# Randomise offsets for the coordinates to try to avoid plagiarism with similar tests.
# If this is set to true, the generator will generate a random offset for each coordinate.
# The offsets are between [-60, 60] for latitude and [-150, 150] for longitude.

# Arrange phase
# This is what the model looks like before the test is run
# It is used to generate arrange.zip.

# Assert phase
# This is what is expected to happen after the test is run
#
# If the 'exception' field is present, it means that an exception is expected to be thrown.
# Otherwise, the 'model' field is expected to be the final model after the test is run.
# Depending on the given field, either assert.txt or assert.zip will be generated.
#
# The calendar field is optional inside this model.
# If it's not present, it will be taken from the 'arrange' phase.
